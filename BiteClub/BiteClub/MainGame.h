* @class MainGame
* @brief A class that holds all of the game components and runs the game loop.
*
* The MainGame class is responsible for holding the instances of each component of the game,
* using them (and the input it gathers) to create a functioning game world. At least, that
* is the theory.

* @author Alfred Malone
* @version 01
* @date 17/4/2017 Alfred Malone, created class
*
* @author Alfred Malone
* @version 02
* @date 26/4/2017 Alfred Malone, added Doxygen comments (and plenty more previously)
*
* @author Alfred Malone
* @version 03
* @date 27/4/2017 Alfred Malone, added file loader for init from files
*
* @todo Get collision detection and the camera working. We're toast.

* @bug My shoddy redo of the Camera class.
